\section{Pre-Trained Models}
This section describes the results obtained using different pre-trained architecture and strategies. The pre-trained networks here tested are:
\begin{itemize}
\item VGG16
\item ResNet50V2
\item ResNet101V2
\item InceptionV3
\end{itemize}

 
 
\subsection{VGG16}

\subsubsection{Test 1: Classical VGG16 (Feature Extraction)}
VGG16\ref{fig:vgg16} is a convolutional neural network model proposed by Simonyan et al., with several 3x3 convolutional layers in cascade occasionally interleaved with 2x2 max-pooling layers forming the so called \textit{blocks}. Developed for the ILSVRC2014 challenge, it was able to achieve a top-5 accuracy of 92.7 on ImageNet.

\subsection{ResNet50V2}

\subsubsection{Test 1: Classical ResNet50V2 (Feature Extraction)}
On a small dataset, overfitting will be the main issue. Data augmentation is a powerful way to fight overfitting when youâ€™re working with image data.
