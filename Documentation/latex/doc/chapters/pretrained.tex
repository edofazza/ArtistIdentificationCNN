\subsubsection{Test 1: Classical ResNet50V2 with 50 classes}
On a small dataset, overfitting will be the main issue. Data augmentation is a powerful way to fight overfitting when youâ€™re working with image data.

\subsubsection{Test 3: 1 and 2 with Data Augmentation}

\subsubsection{Test 4: Fine Tuning with One Layer}

\subsubsection{Test 5: Fine Tuning with Two Layers}

\subsubsection{Test 6: Genetic Algorithm for Hyper-parameters and Architecture Optimization}
